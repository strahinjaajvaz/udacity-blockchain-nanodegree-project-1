# Project 1

This is the first project in the Udacity Blockchain Developer Nanodegree Program.

## Task

The task was to create our own blockchain with boilerplate that was provided.

## Comments

1. I've included the api collection from insomnia
2. I've created a small utility to help validate wallet address. I was getting a lot of Errors because the wallet i was issued wasn't created with the legacy flag.
